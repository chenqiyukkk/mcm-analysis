2026 MCM Problem C: Wordle Game Analysis

Background

The New York Times' Wordle game has become a global phenomenon. Understanding player behavior and game patterns can provide insights into human cognition and decision-making. This problem requires you to analyze Wordle game data and develop models to understand player strategies.

Problem Statement

Task 1: Develop a model to predict the distribution of reported scores for a given Wordle puzzle. Your model should consider word difficulty, letter frequency, and player skill levels.

Task 2: Classify solution words by difficulty level. Identify what features make a word harder or easier to solve, and validate your classification against historical data.

Task 3: Analyze the impact of word attributes (vowel count, repeated letters, commonality) on player performance. Develop a metric to quantify word difficulty.

Task 4: Predict future trends in Wordle player behavior. How will player performance evolve as the game matures and vocabulary becomes more familiar?

Data Description

The following data files are provided for your analysis:

- wordle_data.csv: Contains daily puzzle results including word, date, and score distribution
- player_stats.xlsx: Player-level statistics including games played and success rates  
- word_attributes.json: Linguistic features for each solution word
- historical_trends.txt: Longitudinal data on player behavior over time

You must use all provided datasets in your analysis and cannot use external APIs.

Requirements

1. Your model must achieve at least 85% accuracy on the test set for Task 1.
2. You should provide confidence intervals for all predictions in Task 2.
3. The maximum length of your paper is 25 pages including references.
4. You must include sensitivity analysis for key model parameters in Task 3.
5. All code must be included in the appendix and properly documented.

Assumptions

- Assume that player behavior is consistent across different time zones.
- Word difficulty is primarily determined by letter frequency and pattern recognition.
- The player population is representative of general English speakers.
- No significant external events (viral trends, media coverage) affect player behavior during the analysis period.

Constraints

- You cannot use machine learning libraries' built-in automated feature selection.
- All models must be interpretable with clear feature importance metrics.
- You must cite all data sources and previous Wordle analyses.
- The prediction model must run in under 5 minutes on standard hardware.
