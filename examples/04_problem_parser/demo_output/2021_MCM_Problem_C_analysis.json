  "raw_text": "2021 MCM \nProblem C: Confirming the Buzz about Hornets \n \nIn September 2019, a colony of Vespa mandarinia (also known as the Asian giant hornet) was \ndiscovered on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The nest was quickly destroyed, \nbut the news of the event spread rapidly throughout the area. Since that time, several confirmed \nsightings of the pest have occurred in neighboring Washington State, as well as a multitude of \nmistaken sightings. See Figure 1 below for a map of detections, hornet watches, and public \nsightings. \n \n \n  \n \nFigure 1: Map depicting Asian Giant Hornet Detections, as \nwell as Hornet Watch and Public Siting locations.1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n获取更多数学建模相关资料关注【公众号：数模加油站】\n获取更多数学建模相关资料关注【公众号：数模加油站】\nVespa mandarinia is the largest species of hornet in the world, and the occurrence of the nest was \nalarming. Additionally, the giant hornet is a predator of European honeybees, invading and \ndestroying their nests. A small number of the hornets are capable of destroying a whole colony \nof European honeybees in a short time. At the same time, they are voracious predators of other \ninsects that are considered agricultural pests. \nThe life cycle of this hornet is similar to many other wasps. Fertilized queens emerge in the \nspring and begin a new colony. In the fall, new queens leave the nest and will spend the winter in \nthe soil waiting for the spring. A new queen has a range estimated at 30km for establishing her \nnest. \nMore detailed information on Asian hornets is included in the problem attachments and can \nalso be found online.  \nDue to the potential severe impact on local honeybee populations, the presence of Vespa \nmandarinia can cause a good deal of anxiety. The State of Washington has created helplines and \na website for people to report sightings of these hornets. Based on these reports from the public, \nthe state must decide how to prioritize its limited resources to follow-up with additional \ninvestigation. While some reports have been determined to be Vespa mandarinia, many other \nsightings have turned out to be other types of insects.  \nThe primary questions for this problem are “How can we interpret the data provided by the \npublic reports?” and “What strategies can we use to prioritize these public reports for additional \ninvestigation given the limited resources of government agencies?” \nYour paper should explore and address the following aspects: \n Address and discuss whether or not the spread of this pest over time can be predicted,\nand with what level of precision.\n Most reported sightings mistake other hornets for the Vespa mandarinia. Use only the \ndata set file provided, and (possibly) the image files provided, to create, analyze, and \ndiscuss a model that predicts the likelihood of a mistaken classification.\n Use your model to discuss how your classification analyses leads to prioritizing\ninvestigation of the reports most likely to be positive sightings.\n Address how you could update your model given additional new reports over time, and\nhow often the updates should occur.\n Using your model, what would constitute evidence that the pest has been eradicated in\nWashington State?\n Finally, your report should include a two-page memorandum that summarizes your results for \nthe Washington State Department of Agriculture.  \n获取更多数学建模相关资料关注【公众号：数模加油站】\n获取更多数学建模相关资料关注【公众号：数模加油站】\nYour PDF solution of no more than 25 total pages should include:  \n One-page Summary Sheet.  \n Table of Contents.  \n Your complete solution.  \n Two-page Memorandum. \n References list.  \n \nNote: The MCM Contest now has a 25 page limit. All aspects of your submission count toward \nthe 25 page limit (Summary Sheet, Table of Contents, Reference List and any Appendices).  \n \nYou should not make use of unauthorized images and materials whose use is restricted by \ncopyright laws. Ensure you cite the sources for your ideas and the materials used in your report. \n \nGeneral Guidelines for Problem C \n \nIn addition to the specific requirements listed above please keep in mind that this is a statistical \nmodeling exercise. Submissions are expected to adhere to best practices associated with the use \nof data. Some examples of these expectations include but are not limited to the following: \n Define all metrics and cost functions that you use. \n Any estimate of a parameter should include an interval estimate. \n Any result should include estimates with respect to the goodness of fit of the results. \n All assumptions should be clearly stated especially with respect to distributions \nassociated with the data or errors. \n All assumptions associated with the data should be checked, and the robustness of a \ntechnique with respect to those assumptions should be examined. \n All assumptions associated with an approach or technique should be clearly stated. \n \nAttachments \nWe provide the four following materials for this problem. THE DATA FILES PROVIDED \nCONTAIN THE ONLY DATA YOU SHOULD USE FOR THIS PROBLEM. \n \n1. 2021MCM_ProblemC_Vespamandarinia.pdf  \nBackground information from Pennsylvania State University Extension that describes the insect.  \n \n2. 2021MCM_ProblemC_DataSet.xlsx \nA spreadsheet with 4440 reports of sightings with the following fields: \nGlobalID: a unique label for each sighting record.  \nDetection Date: the reported date of the sighting. \nNotes: comments provided by the person submitting the report. This can be a member of \nthe public, or occasionally a state employee. \nLab Status: the official classification of the sighting by the state department of \nagriculture after analysis. Positive ID means it is confirmed as an Asian Giant Hornet. \nNegative ID means it is excluded. Unprocessed means it has not yet been classified. \nUnverified means no determination was made due to lack of information.  \nLab Comments: what the state entomology lab added to the record after analysis. \n获取更多数学建模相关资料关注【公众号：数模加油站】\n获取更多数学建模相关资料关注【公众号：数模加油站】\nSubmission Date: the date the report was made to the state. This date can be significantly \nafter the detection date.  \nLatitude (of sighting): these data are provided by the state after converting the address \nprovided by the report.  \nLongitude (of sighting): these data are provided by the state after converting the address \nprovided by the report.  \n \n \n3. 2021MCM_ProblemC_Files.rar \nA rar file with 3305 images submitted with the sighting reports. \nThe 662MB file can be downloaded from: \nhttp://www.comapmath.com/MCMICM/2021MCM_ProblemC_Files.rar \nA password is required to open the file: Af6SP7rdm33PxPJmDb4wZq7cw \n \n4. 2021MCM ProblemC_ Images_by_GlobalID.xlsx \nA spreadsheet mapping the images to the sightings with the following fields:  \nFileName: the name of an image in the rar folder. \nGlobalID: a unique label for each sighting record. This is consistent across the two \nspreadsheets. \nFileType: Images arrive as .jpg, .pdf, .png, .jfif, octet-stream, xml open format, or .zip \nfiles. Videos arrive as .mp4 or quicktime files.  \n \nReference \n1.
