## 1. Visual Requirements (Crucial)

- [ ] **Figure 1**: Schematic/Photo of problem background (in Introduction).
- [ ] **Figure 2**: Method comparison (Chart or Table in Lit Review).
- [ ] **Figure 3**: **Workflow Diagram / Mindmap** (in "Our Work"). ⭐
- [ ] **Figure 4**: Data visualization (Map/Distribution).
- [ ] **Figure 5+**: Framework diagram for **EACH** model (Model I, Model II).
- [ ] **Results**: At least 1-2 charts per Task.
- [ ] **Sensitivity**: At least 1 Sensitivity Analysis chart (Tornado/Heatmap).
- [ ] **Total Count**: **15+ Figures/Tables**.

## 2. Content & Structure

### Summary Sheet
- [ ] 1 Page strictly.
- [ ] Specific numbers included (e.g., "accuracy of 95%", "reduction of 15%").
- [ ] Clear structure: Problem -> Model -> Results -> Conclusion.

### Introduction
- [ ] **Background**: 300+ words, cited data source.
- [ ] **Literature Review**: 200+ words, 3+ citations, comparison table.
- [ ] **Restatement**: Own words, bullet points for tasks.
- [ ] **Our Work**: Workflow diagram + structure overview.

### Model Preparation
- [ ] **Assumptions**: 4-6 items, each with **Justification**.
- [ ] **Notations**: Table with Symbol, Definition, Unit.
- [ ] **Data**: Source table + Visualization (if data provided).

### Model Establishment
- [ ] **Naming**: Models have descriptive names (e.g., "TSRM", "BDS Model").
- [ ] **Diagrams**: Each model has a schematic/flowchart.
- [ ] **Math**: Formulas have numbered equations ($eq:1$).
- [ ] **Variables**: Every variable in formulas is explained immediately after.
- [ ] **Algorithm**: Pseudocode included for numerical methods.

### Results
- [ ] **Task Structure**: Separate subsection for each Task.
- [ ] **Visuals**: Charts referenced in text ("As shown in Figure X...").
- [ ] **Analysis**: Text explains *what* the chart shows, not just *that* it exists.
- [ ] **Validation**: Comparison with baseline or ground truth.

### Evaluation
- [ ] **Sensitivity**: Quantitative analysis (e.g., "varying X by 10%...").
- [ ] **Strengths**: 3-4 points (specific, not generic).
- [ ] **Weaknesses**: 2-3 points (honest, with mitigation).

---

## 3. Formatting & Polish

- [ ] **Font**: Times New Roman, 12pt (standard LaTeX).
- [ ] **Margins**: 1 inch (2.54 cm).
- [ ] **Page Count**: 20-25 pages.
- [ ] **Citations**: Standard academic format, no broken links (`[?]`).
- [ ] **Captions**: Figures have descriptive captions *below*; Tables *above*.

## 4. Common "Fatal" Flaws to Avoid

- [ ] **Thin Content**: Sections with only 1-2 paragraphs.
- [ ] **No Flowchart**: Missing the "Our Work" diagram.
- [ ] **No Data**: Results are purely theoretical without numerical backing.
- [ ] **Wall of Text**: Pages without any visual breaks.
- [ ] **Copy-Paste**: Restating the problem exactly as given.
- [ ] **Unjustified Math**: Throwing formulas without derivation or explanation.
