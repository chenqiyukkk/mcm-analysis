# Type C (Data Insights) Visualization Analysis

## Summary
Type C (Data Insights) papers utilize visualization not just for displaying results, but as a core analytical tool to demonstrate data properties, justify model choices, and validate predictions. The visualization pipeline typically follows a "Describe -> Explain -> Predict" structure:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to understand feature relationships.
2.  **Model Architecture:** Custom flowcharts or schematic diagrams to explain complex hybrid algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks + Differential Equations).
3.  **Validation:** "Prediction vs. Actual" time series plots with error bands or residual analysis to demonstrate model robustness.

## Design Patterns

### 1. The "Model Schematic" is Mandatory
Type C problems often require hybrid models (e.g., ARIMA + Neural Net). **A custom diagram (not a standard chart) is almost always used to explain how these parts fit together.**
*   *Example:* Fig 4 in 2022 Paper (X-Prophet Structure).
*   *Pattern:* Use block diagrams with arrows indicating data flow. Label inputs and outputs clearly.

### 2. Comparative Subplots
When analyzing multiple datasets (e.g., Gold vs. Bitcoin, Hard Mode vs. Normal Mode), authors frequently use **subplots** (Grid Layouts) to show them side-by-side sharing the same x-axis.
*   *Benefit:* Allows immediate visual comparison of trends and volatility.

### 3. Verification Visualizations
Trust is built through "Diagnostic Plots":
*   **Residual Plots:** Showing that the error is random (good) vs. patterned (bad).
*   **Sensitivity Bands:** Shaded regions around a line chart representing confidence intervals (e.g., 95% CI).

### 4. Correlation is Key
Almost every Type C paper includes a **Correlation Heatmap** early in the paper. It serves as visual proof that the authors understand the data before modeling it.

## Recommendations for Templates

### 1. Pre-computation Visualization
*   **Correlation Matrix:** Standardize a template for a Seaborn-style heatmap with annotated coefficients.
*   **Data Decomposition:** For time series, a standard "Trend + Seasonality + Residual" decomposition plot.

### 2. Model Explanation
*   **Flowchart Template:** A generic "Input -> Preprocessing -> Model -> Output" diagram that can be customized.
*   **Hybrid Structure:** A template showing how a statistical model feeds into a machine learning model (Residual learning).

### 3. Results Validation
*   **"The Fit Plot":** A high-quality line chart showing Actual Data (Solid Line) vs. Predicted Data (Dashed Line) with a shaded Confidence Interval.
*   **"Error Analysis":** A histogram of residuals or a scatter plot of Predicted vs. Residuals.
