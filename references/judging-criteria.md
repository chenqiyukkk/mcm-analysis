## What Judges Look For

### Summary Sheet (CRITICAL)
> "The judges place considerable weight on the summary, and winning papers are often distinguished from other papers based on the quality of the summary."

**Good Summary**:
- Inspires reader to learn about your work
- Clearly describes approach
- Prominently features most important conclusions
- NOT a restatement of the problem
- NOT a cut-and-paste from Introduction

**Bad Summary**:
- Mere restatement of contest problem
- Boilerplate from Introduction
- Vague or generic statements

### Overall Paper Quality

| Element | What Judges Want |
|---------|------------------|
| **Organization** | Articulate, concise, easy to follow |
| **Table of Contents** | Helps preview organization |
| **Problem Restatement** | Clarification in your own words |
| **Variables** | Clear exposition of all variables |
| **Assumptions** | Stated and justified with reasoning |
| **Model Motivation** | Analysis motivating model choice |
| **Derivations** | Summarized in body, details in appendix |
| **Model Testing** | Error analysis, sensitivity, stability |
| **Strengths/Weaknesses** | Honest self-assessment |
| **Conclusions** | Explicit results reported |
| **References** | Properly documented |

## Practical Scoring Rubric

| 3 | Reasonable model, some justification gaps |
| 2 | Basic model, weak justification |
| 1 | Inappropriate or missing model |

### Analysis & Results (25%)
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Comprehensive analysis, sensitivity testing, validation |
| 4 | Good analysis, some validation |
| 3 | Basic analysis, limited validation |
| 2 | Incomplete analysis |
| 1 | Missing or wrong analysis |

### Communication (20%)
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Excellent writing, clear figures, easy to follow |
| 4 | Good writing, clear organization |
| 3 | Adequate writing, some clarity issues |
| 2 | Poor organization, hard to follow |
| 1 | Unreadable or very poorly written |

### Summary Quality (15%)
| Score | Description |

| 5 | Compelling, complete, inspires reading |
| 4 | Good summary, covers key points |
| 3 | Adequate summary, missing some elements |
| 2 | Weak summary, vague or incomplete |
| 1 | Missing or very poor summary |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Disqualification Risks
1. **Plagiarism**: Always cite sources, use quotes for verbatim text
2. **Online Help**: Never post problems or seek help online during contest
3. **Identifying Info**: No names, no school names anywhere in paper

### Quality Reduction Risks
1. **Weak Summary**: Don't rush the summary - write it last, make it best
2. **No Sensitivity Analysis**: Always test model robustness
3. **Unjustified Assumptions**: Every assumption needs reasoning
4. **Poor Organization**: Use clear sections and transitions
5. **Missing Requirements**: Address ALL parts of the problem
6. **Exceeding Page Limit**: 25 pages maximum, no exceptions
