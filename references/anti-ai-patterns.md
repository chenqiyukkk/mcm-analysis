# Anti-AI Patterns: Writing Like a Human

This reference documents writing patterns from 6 MCM/ICM 2024 O-award papers that make academic writing appear MORE human and LESS like AI-generated text.

---

## 1. Sentence Length Variation

### Observed Patterns

Human writers naturally alternate between short and long sentences. AI tends to produce consistently medium-length sentences.

**Short sentences (5-12 words) - Used for:**
- Emphasis: "This is consistent with the facts."
- Transitions: "The results are good."
- Conclusions: "Therefore, we choose LVMH."
- Impact statements: "Time is crucial for rescue operations."

**Long sentences (30-50 words) - Used for:**
- Complex explanations with multiple clauses
- Methodological descriptions
- Qualification of results

### Real Examples from Papers

**Paper B - Short punchy sentence:**
> "Time is Life: Precise Localization and Faster Search"

**Paper C - Mix of lengths:**
> "The first set was easily won by Djokovic, but the second was tense...... This is consistent with the facts. Thus, the reliability of the algorithm is verified."

**Paper D - Variation pattern:**
> "The Great Lakes represent 20% of the world's freshwater resources, making their management, especially in water level, critically important. [LONG] Fluctuations in their water levels are influenced by a myriad of natural factors and involve a diverse group of stakeholders. [LONG] Consequently, developing a management plan and controlling the water levels of these lakes present a challenge. [MEDIUM]"

### Recommended Ratio
- 20% short sentences (under 15 words)
- 60% medium sentences (15-30 words)
- 20% long sentences (30+ words)

## 2. Natural Uncertainty Expression

### Human Hedging (Natural)
Real academic writers express uncertainty without overusing modal verbs.

**Good patterns from papers:**

| Context | Human Expression | AI Tendency |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Results | "The results suggest that..." | "It can be concluded that..." |
| Possibility | "This may indicate..." | "This potentially indicates..." |
| Limitation | "The model is less applicable for..." | "The model may not be fully applicable for..." |
| Reasoning | "The reason is that..." | "This can be attributed to the fact that..." |
| Approximation | "roughly proportional to" | "approximately proportional to" |

**Real examples:**

Paper A:
> "This **may indicate** that parasites of lampreys' populations are predominantly parasitized by lampreys' mature bodies."

Paper E:
> "We **believe** this project is ideally suitable for LVMH..."

Paper F:
> "We **assume** that these dimensions have m indicators..."

### Uncertainty Hierarchy (from papers)
1. Strong confidence: "The results show that..."
2. Moderate confidence: "This suggests that..."
3. Tentative: "This may indicate..."
4. Speculative: "One possible explanation is..."

---

## 3. Personal Voice and "We" Usage

### Natural "We" Patterns

Human writers use "we" in varied, context-appropriate ways:

**Active research voice:**
- "We developed a model to..."
- "We calculated the scores for..."
- "We chose to classify..."
- "We conducted first-order differencing..."

**Inclusive reasoning:**
- "We can conclude that..."
- "We can see from Figure 7 that..."
- "We therefore do not consider..."

**Honest acknowledgment:**
- "We only estimate an approximate value"
- "We couldn't find match data for various surfaces in the limited time"
- "We believe that our model has reasonable outcomes"

### Describing the Process (Human Touch)

Real papers describe their **journey**, not just results:

Paper C:
> "Upon consulting relevant information, we found the following explanation..."

Paper B:
> "To solve and validate the model we established, we randomly select a point..."

Paper F:
> "What seems difficult is to assure the fully complete data in the procession of collecting."

---

## 4. Practical Acknowledgments

### Honest Limitations

Human writers acknowledge practical constraints:

**From Paper C:**
> "While we believe our model is applicable across surfaces, unfortunately, we couldn't find match data for various surfaces in the limited time, which will be part of our future work."

**From Paper B:**
> "Due to the difficulty in calculating the drag coefficient, this paper only estimates an approximate value."

**From Paper D:**
> "Stakeholders are not considered comprehensively enough, and the determination of relative weights can also be based on more professional opinions."

### Acknowledging Uncertainty in Data

**From Paper E:**
> "The availability of the data is a crucial issue, therefore it is necessary for us to process the missing data properly..."

---

## 5. Domain-Specific Vocabulary

### Technical Terms AI Often Misses

Papers use field-specific terminology naturally:

**Ecology (Paper A):**
- "Logistic growth"
- "Intraspecific competition coefficient"
- "Neutral buoyancy point"
- "Filter-feeding organic debris"

**Engineering (Paper B):**
- "Fourth-order Runge-Kutta method"
- "Laminar flow state"
- "Reynolds number"
- "Wetting perimeter length"

**Sports Analytics (Paper C):**
- "Leverage" (specific meaning in sports)
- "Hot hands" phenomenon
- "Service break"
- "Tiebreak"

**Control Systems (Paper D):**
- "Mode-switchable feedback controller"
- "Hysteresis effect"
- "PID controller"
- "Decoupling of water level control"

---

## 6. Imperfections That Appear Human

### Minor Informalities

**Ellipsis for dramatic effect:**
> "The first set was easily won by Djokovic, but the second was tense......"

**Colloquial transitions:**
> "Worse still, we discovered that..."

**Direct addressing:**
> "It is worth noting that..."

### Practical Language

**From Paper F:**
> "What seems difficult is to assure the fully complete data"

**From Paper B:**
> "Maritime search and rescue time is precious. One hour is sufficient if the rescue preparations are thorough."

## 7. AI Phrases to AVOID vs Human Alternatives

| AI Tendency | Human Alternative (from papers) |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| "It is important to note that..." | "It is worth noting that..." |
| "In conclusion, it can be stated that..." | "In summary..." / "In conclusion..." |
| "This comprehensive analysis reveals..." | "The results show that..." |
| "leveraging advanced methodologies" | "using [specific method name]" |
| "a holistic approach" | "a comprehensive evaluation" |
| "in the context of" | "for" / "in" / "when" |
| "plays a crucial role" | "is critical for" / "significantly impacts" |
| "It is evident that..." | "We can see that..." |
| "multifaceted" | "diverse" / "various" |
| "a plethora of" | "many" / "numerous" |
| "delve into" | "investigate" / "examine" |
| "Furthermore, it should be noted..." | "Additionally..." / "Also..." |
| "This underscores the importance..." | "This shows that..." |
| "In light of the aforementioned..." | "Based on this..." / "Therefore..." |
| "paramount importance" | "critical" / "crucial" |
| "nuanced understanding" | "detailed understanding" |
| "seamlessly integrate" | "combine" / "integrate" |

## 8. Transition Patterns

### Natural Academic Transitions

**From the papers:**

**Sequential:**
- "Firstly... Secondly... Then..."
- "Next, we..."
- "Following this, we..."

**Causal:**
- "Therefore, we..."
- "Consequently..."
- "Thus..."
- "As a result..."

**Contrastive:**
- "However..."
- "On the other hand..."
- "Conversely..."
- "In contrast..."

**Additive:**
- "Additionally..."
- "Furthermore..."
- "Besides..."
- "Moreover..."

### Avoid Over-Formal Transitions
- ~~"In light of the aforementioned"~~ → "Based on this"
- ~~"Notwithstanding the above"~~ → "However"
- ~~"It bears mentioning that"~~ → "Note that"

## 9. Figure and Table References

### Human Patterns

**Direct references:**
> "As shown in Figure 6..."
> "The results are displayed in Figure 8..."
> "We can observe from Figure 15..."

**Integrated references:**
> "Figure 11 shows that the population size of lampreys..."
> "According to Figure 10(a), we can see that..."

**Parenthetical:**
> "...as illustrated in Figure 2."
> "...as depicted in Figure 3(a)."

### Avoid
- "The visualization presented in Figure X demonstrates..."
- "Figure X provides a comprehensive illustration of..."

---

## 10. Conclusion Writing Patterns

### Human Summary Style

**From Paper A:**
> "In conclusion, the changes in the sex ratio of lampreys are beneficial to ensure the stability of their population numbers when facing harsh environments. This, in turn, contributes to the stability and sustainability of the larger ecosystem."

**From Paper C:**
> "So 'momentum' does play an important role in the game, and swings in play and runs of success are not random."

### Characteristics:
1. Start with simple connector ("In conclusion," / "In summary,")
2. Restate main finding directly
3. Connect to broader implications
4. Keep it concise (2-4 sentences)

---

## 11. Strength/Weakness Section Patterns

### Honest Self-Assessment

**Strengths (from Paper D):**
> "• The model selects the environmental factors comprehensively and scientifically."
> "• Our model is relatively robust with respect to its configuration parameters."

**Weaknesses (from Paper D):**
> "• Stakeholders are not considered comprehensively enough..."
> "• The dam control algorithm can generally consider the hydrological conditions..."

**Weaknesses (from Paper B):**
> "• Due to the difficulty in calculating the drag coefficient, this paper only estimates an approximate value."

### Pattern:
- Use bullet points
- Be specific about what works and what doesn't
- Suggest improvements for weaknesses
- Keep balanced (not overly critical or praise-heavy)

---

## 12. Mathematical Expression Context

### Human Integration of Math

**Before equations:**
> "The mathematical expectation of r is..."
> "According to Archimedes' principle of buoyancy, we have:"
> "The relationship can be expressed as:"

**After equations:**
> "where X represents the time series..."
> "Here, N and N are constant coefficients..."

**Linking equations to meaning:**
> "This equation shows that when the water level error of Lake Huron-Lake Michigan reaches a certain threshold, the controller will balance the water level downstream."
